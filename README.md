# Questions

1. What are you proud of?
I am proud that I got the project from red to green and feel like I have a good
grasp on the concepts involved in the project.
1. What do you need to improve?
I need to improve on my design.  I feel like my code is very very verbose and
can be refactored quite a bit.  I also need to improve my knowledge on instance
variables.
1. What questions do you still have?
When exactly would you use an instance variable versus passing other local variables?
For example, I did a lot of storing the results of a method to a variable, but
what's a better way to do that?  Using instance variables?  I'm not sure.

# Rubric

## Functionality - 3

Notes:

- [x] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics - 3

Notes: Need to work on creating classes that utilize instance variables,
attribute accessors and instance methods.

The student(s):

- [ x] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [ x] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [x] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [ x] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [ ] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design - 2

Notes: Code is too verbose, need to work on refactoring. Variable, method,
and class names are sufficient.

The student(s):

- [ ] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [ ] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [ ] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing - 3

Notes: Need to start writing test code first and then the implementation code.

The student(s):

- [x] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [x] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [x] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [ ] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [ ] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control - 3

Notes: Code is hosted on GitHub, but need to make commits in smaller chunks.

The student(s):

- [x] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [ ] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [x] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
